Follow these steps to set up and run the Security Dashboard:

### 1. Install Node.js Dependencies
Navigate to the `security-dashboard` folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
In the base project folder (not inside `security-dashboard`), create and activate a virtual Python environment:

#### a. Create the environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

#### b. Activate the environment:
- **For Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
- **For Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
Once the environment is active, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Backend Server
Start the backend by running:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### 5. Run the Frontend Development Server
In a separate terminal window, navigate to the `security-dashboard` folder and start the development server:

```bash
npm start dev
```

### 6. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

You should now see the fully functioning security dashboard.
